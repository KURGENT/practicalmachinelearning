Overview:
It is common to use devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit to collect quantified data about personal physical activities. However, there are not much researach done to confirm if such quantified data can predict how well those activities are done. We will use the data from a study called "Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises" by Velloso, Bulling, Gellersen and et.al to investigate whether the manner of the excersices can be predicted by measurements from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants in the study.
